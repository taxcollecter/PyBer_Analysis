# Pyber
## Overview of the Pyber analysis
In this exercise, we reviewed student performance on standardized test by multiple factors (School Size, Type, Funding) while excluding the 9th grade of Thomas High School due to concerns of Academic dishonesty. To perform this analysis, we aggregated data from the student level to show underlying trends in school performance. This work was done to aid the school board in the allocation of funding and budgeting. 

## Results
-How is the district summary affected?
In review of the data at the district level while excluding Thomas High School, it appears as if Reading and Math scores were impacted. Math scores went from a mean of 79.0% to 77.0%. Reading scores went from a mean of 81.9% to 81.0%.

## Summary
In summary, by removing the 9th grade scores of Thomas High School we are seeing an overall negative impact to the School district's Math and Reading scores. If academic dishonesty is at the root of variance, we will need to work with the faculty to ensure this does not happen again and confirm student's confidence in performing during these test. Prior to the data augmentation, the 9th graders at THS led the other grades in Math scores and were 2nd in Reading scores to the 12th graders. By removing the 9th graders scores via this excercise, these 4 data points at a District and School level are visibly impactful. To maintain the school's trend in potential performance, the dishonesty will need to be rooted out.
