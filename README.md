# Pyber
## Overview of the Pyber analysis
Using Pyber’s, a python based ride sharing app, data we’ve been tasked with analyzing how different city types influence the fares collected by the company. Ultimately we’re looking to describe how the differences in fare outcomes can be leveraged, by Leadership, to improve the company’s Financial performance.

## Results
-Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types

### Total Rides
Naturally the "Urban" city type dominates our findings from a Total Rides perspective. Within our dataset the Urban city type managed 1625 rides, while the Suburban and Rural types resulted in 625 and 125 rides respectively.

### Total Drivers
In line with Total Rides, the "Total Drivers" metric also found that the "Urban" city type led our counts with 59602 drivers (error). The Suburban and Rural "Total Driver" counts were significantly lower at 8570 and 537 respectively.

### Total Fares
Again in line with "Total Rides" and "Total Drivers", the "Total Fares" metric heavily skews towards the "Urban" city type with 39854.38 fares (error). The "Suburban" and "Rural" city types significantly trail with 19356.33 and 4327.93 respectively.  

### Average Fare per Ride
In reviewing the "Average Fare per Ride" metric, we noticed that the outcomes actually swapped. the "Rural" city type now leads the members with 34.62 and Suburban and Urban city types now trail with 30.97 and 24.52 respectively. It appears as if the distance traveled by each fare significantly favors the company from a fare perspective. 

### Average Fare per Driver
In line with the Average Fare per Ride metric, we find that the Rural fares pay out better Average Fare per driver at 8.06. The Suburban and Urban city types come in at 2.26 and a dismal .67 respectively. 

### Total Fare by City Type
Reviewing the "Total Fare by City type" we confirm that the Urban fares drastically lead the Suburban and Rural city types in counts. We're finding a quantity over quality situation as it relates to these types.

## Summary
In summary, we've found that the "City type" has a significant impact on the fare value collected by the driver and subsequently the company. We advise the company to prioritize Rural trips as they are more lucrative from a fare perspective. While this is a difficult ask considering the number of rides occurring within the Urban setting, especially from a staffing perspective, the Rural and Suburban areas offer a better ROI.
