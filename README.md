# Pyber
## Overview of the Pyber analysis
Using Pyber’s, a python based ride sharing app, data we’ve been tasked with analyzing how different city types influence the fares collected by the company. Ultimately we’re looking to describe how the differences in fare outcomes can be leveraged, by Leadership, to improve the company’s Financial performance.

## Results
-Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types

### Total Rides
Naturally the "Urban" city type dominates our findings from a Total Rides perspective. Within our dataset the Urban city type managed 1625 rides, while the Suburban and Rural types resulted in 625 and 125 rides respectively.

### Total Drivers
In line with Total Rides, the "Total Drivers" metric also found that the "Urban" city type led our counts with 59602 drivers (error). The Suburban and Rural "Total Driver" counts were significantly lower at 8570 and 537 respectively.

### Total Fares
Again in line with "Total Rides" and "Total Drivers", the "Total Fares" metric heavily skews towards the "Urban" city type with 39854.38 fares (error). The "Suburban" and "Rural" city types significantly trail with 19356.33 and 4327.93 respectively.  

### Average Fare per Ride
In reveiwing the "Average Fare per Ride" metric, we noticed that the outcomes actually swapped. the "Rural" city type now leads the members with 34.62 and Suburban and Urban city types now trail with 30.97 and 24.52 respectively. It appears as if the distance traveled by each fare significantly favors the company from a fare perspective. 

### Average Fare per Driver
In line with 


### Total Fare by City Type

## Summary
In summary, by removing the 9th grade scores of Thomas High School we are seeing an overall negative impact to the School district's Math and Reading scores. If academic dishonesty is at the root of variance, we will need to work with the faculty to ensure this does not happen again and confirm student's confidence in performing during these test. Prior to the data augmentation, the 9th graders at THS led the other grades in Math scores and were 2nd in Reading scores to the 12th graders. By removing the 9th graders scores via this excercise, these 4 data points at a District and School level are visibly impactful. To maintain the school's trend in potential performance, the dishonesty will need to be rooted out.
